### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Del Piero Flores

A student in the ninth semester of my Mechatronics Engineering program. I'm the electronics and strategy chief of [KON Team](https://www.konteam.com/), working on the design of an electric vehicle prototype to compete in the [Shell Eco-Marathon](https://www.makethefuture.shell/en-gb/shell-eco-marathon). I'm interested in the design and implementation of control methods in embedded systems and the research in autonomous vehicles.
