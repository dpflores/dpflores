### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Del Piero Flores

A student in the ninth semester of my Mechatronics Engineering program. I'm the electronics and strategy chief in KON Team, working on the design of an electric prototype to compete in the shell-eco marathon. I'm interested in the design and implementation of control methods in embedded systems and the research in autonomous vehicles.
